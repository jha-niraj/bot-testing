## Pull Request Documentation

		**Date:** 2025-01-30

		## Code Changes:
```js
const details = {
    name: "Niraj Jha",
    age: 23,
};
```

## Explanation:
- The code snippet declares a constant `details` that stores an object with two key-value pairs: `name` and `age`.
- Previously, an additional comma was present after the last key-value pair in the object, which is now removed.
- The code change corrects the syntax error by removing the trailing comma in the object declaration.

## Observations:
- Trailing commas in object declarations are invalid syntax in JavaScript and can lead to errors in some environments.
- By removing the extra comma, the code adheres to proper syntax standards and enhances code readability.
